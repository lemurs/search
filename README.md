# Lemurs Search
_Search without search engines_

The idea is to create a set of browser extensions that will search the few useful sites on the internet directly.

The basic interface is a search bar. Selecting the search bar opens a page of sites. It is easy to change the selection.

Entering a search term searches the selected sites. 
* If one site was selected, the results page is loaded. 
* If multiple sites are selected, results are collated into a local results page that links to the sites.

## Later Features

__Re-Search__ Optionally, entering a new search term creates tabs of previous search terms.

__We-Search__ An open source project for people to contribute additional site plug-ins.

## Business Model

New Lemurs will retain the rights to the default ordering of sites with the intention of letting people bid on placement via a closed source extension. 

## License

To be added later.
